# Exploring Hacker News Posts
In this project, we'll compare two different types of posts from Hacker News, a popular site where technology related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented upon. The two types of posts we'll explore begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`.

Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as "What is the best online course you've ever taken?" Likewise, users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

We'll specifically compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
- Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

__In this project I passed through a complete data science workflow:__
- Set a goal for the project.
- Collected and sorted the data.
- Reformatted and cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis.
- Analyzed the data.

__The tools used are:__
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

The step-by-step milestones and final result are shown [here](https://github.com/AndriiTsokur/data-project-002/blob/main/exploring_hacker_news_posts.ipynb)
